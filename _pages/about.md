# 🐦 About me
I am currently pursuing a combined B.S./M.S./Ph.D. program in Computer Science at [Northeastern University](https://neu.edu.cn/), presently in the master's stage. My research focuses on reasoning and retrieval for large language models in legal scenarios, with broader interests spanning NLP, Information Retrieval, and LLM applications. I am studying at NEUIR Lab under the guidance of Associate Professor [Zhenghao Liu](https://edwardzh.github.io/) from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/).
